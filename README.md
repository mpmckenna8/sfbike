===========

Code and data relating to the Bay Area bike share. As of now I have a KML and geojson data set of the proposed bike share
stations for the launch of the program and some jam that was released to help people participate in a "Open Data Challenge". see http://bayareabikeshare.com/datachallenge

As usual I don't think I'll finish anything by the due time but hopeufully won't stop me or you from making something cool from it soon.

Also see http://bayareabikeshare.com/stations/json for a data feed.  

I hope to provide this data in other formats as well as other datasets relating to
the Bay Area Bike Share soon. I have made a request through Socrata that the MTA share some of their planning data,
but they're more into publishing meaningless maps.

See: https://data.sfgov.org/nominate for my nomination of bikeshare data.
