sfbike map
===========

There're lots of maps out there to bike around San Francisco. From a recent nice print one recently published by the SFMTA to digital maps like OpenStreetmaps cyclelayer, Google Maps and a number of cool individual efforts. A great thing about Google or the OSM cyclelayer is that they deal with data sets which can be applied around the world.  But they make all bike infrastructure look pretty much the same.  Which is where individual attempts at making a map can provide a different perspective.  

Recently I've been trying to look at how to use mapbox-gl with their javascript API.  Using this it would be easy to highlight things in their mapbox-streets dataset (maybe bike shops or landmarks/names).  Plus I could try to add some interactivity.

Lots to try to do with the OpenStreetMap data and SFMTA bike route data. https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/SFMTA-Bicycle-Route-Network/q36i-k43q

It would be nice if it were possible to just draw the sfmta data. But there's proposed bike lanes and some bike lanes are sharrows, some are bike buffers, some are painted green.  It'd like to take a little survey of bike maps and what people would want to see on one and try and make a cool one to which other people could easily improve.

Go ride a bike in SF or help me out with this stuff cause I don't much know what I'm doing.
